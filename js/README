## How to Play ##

When you start the game, you'll be presented with a hidden phrase.
Your goal is to guess the phrase letter by letter.
You can make guesses using the on-screen keyboard or by typing directly on your physical keyboard.
If you guess a letter correctly, it will be revealed in the phrase.
If you guess incorrectly, you'll lose a life.
The game ends when you've guessed all the letters in the phrase or when you run out of lives.
